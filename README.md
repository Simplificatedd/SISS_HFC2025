Submission for Hack For Cities 2025
Team Name: Singapore Institute of Social Sciences

## Project Description

Fresh graduates with limited internship experience and mid-career switchers without relevant expertise often face challenges in identifying the most suitable courses to develop industry-specific skills efficiently. They are uncertain about which courses will equip them with the most relevant skills in the shortest time to improve their employability. 

This project addresses this issue by leveraging Generative AI to create an intelligent chatbot. The chatbot analyzes user-provided data, such as resumes or career goals, and suggests tailored courses from SkillsFuture to help users upskill effectively. 

Upon completion of a recommended course, the chatbot continues its support by providing personalized job listings from CareersFuture, bridging the gap between education and employment. This solution ensures a seamless and guided journey for users, helping them transition into their desired careers with confidence.
