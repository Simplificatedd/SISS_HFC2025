## Project Description  
Overview of the solution and the problem it solves

### Overview  
This project proposes an AI-driven solution to bridge the gap between workforce development and the evolving demands of smart city industries. By leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system integrated with Generative AI, the solution aims to deliver personalised career assistance and skill development recommendations.  

The core of the solution is a chatbot that analyses user resumes to extract skills, qualifications, and experiences. It connects users with relevant job opportunities and upskilling courses by utilizing datasets from **CareersFuture** and **SkillsFuture Singapore**. The chatbot also addresses career-related inquiries, offering tailored advice to help users adapt to the dynamic needs of smart city enterprises.  

### Problem it Solves  
In rapidly evolving industries, individuals often struggle with:  
- Identifying skill gaps and relevant job opportunities.  
- Accessing personalised career guidance.  
- Adapting to the skill demands of smart city economies.  

Governments face challenges in aligning workforce capabilities with industry requirements to promote sustainable economic growth and reduce unemployment.  

This solution directly addresses these challenges by:  
1. Enabling individuals to understand their current capabilities and map them to industry needs.  
2. Guiding users towards targeted skill development using SkillsFuture courses.  
3. Assisting governments in workforce alignment efforts, fostering long-term growth and innovation.  

By empowering citizens with career tools tailored to a smart city context, this project contributes to a more adaptive and future-ready workforce.
