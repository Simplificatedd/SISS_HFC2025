Too little care leads to service inadequacy and negates effectiveness; too much care causes resource wastage and deprives the more needy others.
How do we quantify and measure the level of needs and strengths for the clients when each individual is different and unique? How do we measure the needs and strengths and use the information for service planning, intervention, respond to new needs as individual case workers, agency level or even at a system level?
For this simple reason – their needs and strengths must unfold rightly before the appropriate care and services could be determined.

It also covers risk and hazard identification as well as mitigation measures to allow for handling high voltage vehicles in a safe working environment.

It familiarises participants with the EV battery characteristics and awareness of the charging process. It will further cover the architecture design of the HV system and components and equip knowledge on performing diagnosis, troubleshooting and basic maintenance of these systems.","Under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, LTA has a comprehensive Electric Vehicle (EV) Roadmap to drive EV adoption.  LTA has set a target of 60,000 EV charging points by 2030 and phase out Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles by 2040.

While the industry is moving towards sustainable energy, i.e. hybrid and electric vehicle, there is a need to upgrade the skill level of techni-cians to meet this new demand.  The potential safety concerns of handling the maintenance and repair of high voltage vehicles calls for the need to ensure that technicians are equipped with the competencies of National EV Specialist Safety (NESS) standards.  

Based on the market study from the Singapore Motor Workshop Association (SMWA), there are generally about 10,000 automotive techni-cians in Singapore (Local & Foreign).  However, there are only less than a handful of institutions currently in Singapore providing some form of high voltage vehicle training programs. 

Hence, ComfortDelGro Engineering (CDGE) formed a partnership with TUV SUD to roll out an EV training program for the automotive engi-neering industry.  TUV SUD would provide course curriculum for the EV training program while  CDGE would conduct the program in its training academy in Loyang for internal employees as well as external participants.  This collaboration aims to upskill Automotive Technicians from ICE technology to Qualified Technicians in safe handling of high voltage vehicles through a national-level certification programme. 

This course is suitable for technicians, service advisors, workshop managers and engineers from the automotive engineering industry, as well as personnel and enthusiasts from vehicle sales, insurance, surveyor and inspection companies.

With equal excitement and trepidation, we find ourselves asking how to build a future augmented by the potential benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), while avoiding its pitfalls.

Every day we hear more about the potential of AI-powered systems that will transform how we work, create, solve problems, communicate, and even diagnose and treat illness. The possibilities of advanced AI seem unlimited. But without proper testing, evaluation, validation, and verification at each stage of AI development, foundational AI models could perpetuate biases and amplify other societal challenges that will cascade through later systems and remain for decades. We must continue to build and refine the governance processes through which trustworthy AI will emerge and we must invest in the people who will build ethical and responsible AI.

About the team and role

Strategy3 is Ipsos’ business and growth advisory firm.
We believe that in order for any business strategy, marketing plan, brand positioning, or new innovation to be successful, it must do threethings: be rooted in the organization’s strategy, be informed and inspired by customer research, and it must drive through to actual in-market activation.
While many firms advise on growth, very few deliver on all three: traditional management consultancies rarely delve deep enough into the world of the customer; creative firms don’t truly leverage the power of data; research agencies can sometimes lose the big picture amid analysis. That’s why we are Strategy3.

Consulting Directors are the 'entrepreneurs' of the office or business. They drive sales and service offerings and build organisation capability by leading in the human resource and business management processes of the organisation. With clients, they are the ultimate authority to approve work and manage the relationship at the senior level.

What you will do

Strategic Insight:
A trusted adviser for strategic direction, change management and growth. Is experienced in different domains and holds insight into the values of different clients. Has a track record of building trust and gravitas with clients through thought provoking business acumen and innovative strategies.

Delivering Results:
Drives growth and sustains profits with solid sales track and business success. Ensures quality project deliverables for all projects – taking the main accountability for their team’s innovative strategies and achievement of results. Is responsible for the achievement of office P&L targets.

Leading and Managing:
Inspires, gains support and oversees the implementation and achievement of the organisation's strategic goals. Builds an effective management team to run the business. Leads and advances the growth of the business with a continuous view to profit. Leads and advocates key internal human resource and management processes for organisational growth. Is responsible for the sustainability and growth strategy of the greater S3 team.

Building Client Relations:
Creates, fosters and grows deep, trusted relationships with top management of existing and potential clients. Builds strong confidence and value with the senior management of clients by providing informed advice, guiding them to make more informed business decisions through cooperation with Ipsos

Knowledge and Market Capability:
An acknowledged expert in at least one related business capability, with frequent invitations to speak at industry events or for the sharing and discussing of Ipsos experiences and insights. Is known to be increasing in knowledge and experience in new domains and new project areas.

Who you are
8-10 or more years of prior business experience experience within a similar consulting capacity, or as an industry profession with specific sector knowledge.
Bachelor’s degree from renowned universities. An MBA, Masters degree or industry certifications in related field will be advantageous."

Property and Asset Management

What this job involves:

Being the glue that binds
Working as part of a team and assisting the headquarters portfolio managers, you’ll play a key role in our delivery of quality property management services to clients. You’ll drive initiatives that help improve our capabilities in achieving the highest service levels expected by our clients. You’ll achieve such an outcome by building strong relationships not only with your team members, but also with the property’s council members and residents.

Beating the daily grind
You’ll plan the daily operations and ensure the general maintenance of the condominium. Preparing and implementing an emergency/crisis management plan will also be part of handling the operations. Handling daily operations should be in compliance with the relevant building statutory requirements.

Creating an operation rhythm
In this role, you’ll ensure that your team gets through the daily grind of managing condominium properties. Particularly, you’ll be on top of the planning to achieve optimal daily operations—from the basic stuff to the nitty gritty details such as emergency/crisis management plan preparation and rollout. While all these sound like routine on the surface, getting everything in compliance with the relevant building statutory requirements should keep things exciting.

Going into the details
You’ll keep all details in check, specifically in terms of budget and financial transactions. You need to be on the lookout for the vendors’ intention to renew their contracts, as well as ensure proper delivery of all their invoices and insurance. You’ll have to be as accurate as possible as you may have to discuss such details during monthly council and annual general meetings.

Sound like you? To apply, you need to be:
If you’re a residential property management professional, with at least three to five years’ experience, come talk to us. We’re keen to know more about you. It’s also helpful if you have a working knowledge of condominium management software and a knack for keeping up with the latest tools of the trade. You should also have the capability to deal with an up-tempo work environment, where you can put your strong business, marketing, and management sense into great use.

An active, team-oriented leader
Do you have what it takes to build a strong and flexible team? Can you embed strong work ethics in people’s values, while at the same time keeping them well trained and motivated? If your answer is yes, then you might be the one we are looking for.

A critical thinker with consummate communications skills
You must be a problem solver who can get your message across. Additionally, having effective interpersonal skills will help you make sure everyone understands what needs done exactly. You must be level-headed during difficult times, and flexible and capable enough to carry your team through. You’re one who never gets tired of learning, as you need such an attitude to adjust in a fast-paced work environment.

What you can expect from us
At JLL, we make sure that you become the best version of yourself by helping you realise your full potential in an entrepreneurial and inclusive work environment. We will empower your ambitions through our dedicated Total Rewards Program, competitive pay and benefits package.

Activate Interactive Pte Ltd (“Activate”) is a leading technology consultancy headquartered in Singapore with a presence in Malaysia and Indonesia. Our clients are empowered with quality, cost-effective, and impactful end-to-end application development, like mobile and web applications, and cloud technology that remove technology roadblocks and increase their business efficiency.
We believe in positively impacting the lives of people around us and the environment we live in through the use of technology. Hence, we are committed to providing a conducive environment for all employees to realise their full potential, who in turn have the opportunity to continuously drive innovation.
We are searching for our next team members to join our growing team.
If you love the idea of being part of a growing company with exciting prospects in mobile and web technologies that create positive impact on people’s lives, then we would love to hear from you.
Build prototypes to demonstrate technological opportunities
Design system architectures
Write production quality code
Manage deployments to cloud infrastructure
Because our team focuses on pushing new initiatives, you will also have to:
Identify potential projects that improve the public good
Design novel systems that work around bureaucratic constraints
Advocate and explain these technical ideas to other government agencies
Additionally, more senior engineers will be expected to:
Establish best practices for developer operations
Share your expertise and mentor other engineers
Help with recruiting
You’re not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it.
Your job will be to bring expertise and capability to the public sector. Sometimes this means coding new systems from scratch. Other times this means using the best solutions the development community has to offer. We use cloud services, open source software, and commodity hardware as far as possible. These often include, but are not limited to: GitHub, AWS, React Native, MongoDB, and Stripe amongst others. Knowing what to build and what to reuse: let us avoid wasting time on solved problems and focus on delivering actual value.
You will work on meaningful projects that solve problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. You will have direct ownership of your work with over 70% of our projects starting as ground up initiatives. Rather than work on commercial ventures commonly found in the startup scene, we’re here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.
We work mostly in Javascript with some Python on the backend. However, we don’t require experience in any specific programming language or technology. Core competency in at least one language and the ability to learn is what matters to us.
What are we looking for?
At least 2 years experience of Javascript and Python
Have a demonstrated ability to build software
Prior work and personal projects count for much more than specific degrees
Write code to solve abstract programming problems
Clear thinking, the ability to debug, and understanding the limits of an approach matter much more than getting the “correct” answer
Talk and reason about code with other engineers
We work as a team so you need to be able to not just solve problems, but have other people understand your solutions
Take initiative to make things happen
Our job is to push for change in government, so we need to challenge the status quo and not wait for instruction
Want to work for the public good - We are public servants, we serve the public.
This sometimes means ignoring political pressures and misguided policies.
We need people who will push back if something is not in the public interest
Overall we look for people who have ability, initiative, good communication, and strong values.
What do we offer in return?
